Dr. Oppenheimer.

I'm Colonel Groves.

This is Lieutenant
Colonel Nichols.

Have that dry-cleaned.

Well, if that's how you
treat Lieutenant Colonel,

I'd hate to see how you
treat a humble physicist.

Ah, if I ever meet
one, I'll let you know.

Ouch.

Theaters of combat
all over the world,

but I have to stay
in Washington.

- Why?
- I built the Pentagon.

The brass likes it so much
they made me take over

the Manhattan Engineer District.

Which is?

Oh, don't be a smart ass. You
know damn well what it is.

You and half of every
physics department

across the country.
That's problem number one.

I thought problem
number one would be

securing enough uranium ore.

1,200 tons bought the
day I took charge.

Processing?

Just broke ground at
Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

Now I'm looking for
a project director.

And my name came up?

Nope.

Even though you brought
quantum physics to America.

Which made me curious.

What have you found out?

You're a dilettante,
a womanizer,

a suspected Communist...

I'm a New Deal Democrat.

I said "suspected."

Unstable, theatrical,
egotistical, neurotic...

Nothing good, no?

Not even "he's
brilliant, but..."

Well, brilliance is
taken for granted

in your circle, so no.

No, the only person who
had anything good to say

was Richard Tolman.

Tolman thinks you
have integrity,

but he also strikes me as a guy

who knows more about
science than people.

Yet here you are. You
don't take much on trust.

I don't take anything on trust.

Why don't you have
a Nobel Prize?

Why aren't you a general?

They're making me one for this.

Perhaps I'll have the same luck.

A Nobel Prize for making a bomb?

Alfred Nobel invented dynamite.

So how would you proceed?

You're talking
about turning theory

into a practical weapons system

faster than the Nazis.

Who have a 12-month head start.

Eighteen.

How could you
possibly know that?

Our fast neutron
research took six months.

The man they've
undoubtedly put in charge

will have made that
leap instantly.

Who do you think
they put in charge?

Werner Heisenberg.

He has the most
intuitive understanding

of atomic structure
I have ever seen.

- You know his work?
- I know him.

Just like I know Walther
Bothe, von Weizsäcker, Diebner.

In a straight race,
the Germans win.

- We've got one hope.
- Which is?

Anti-Semitism.

What?

Hitler called quantum
physics "Jewish science."

Said it right to
Einstein's face.


Our one hope is that Hitler
is so... so blinded by hate

that he's denied Heisenberg
proper resources,

because it'll take
vast resources.

Our nation's best
scientists working together.

Right now, they're scattered.

Which gives us
compartmentalization.

All minds have to
see the whole task

to contribute efficiently.

Poor security may
cost us the race.

Inefficiency will.

The Germans know
more than us anyway.

The Russians don't.

Remind me, who are
we at war with?

Somebody with your past
doesn't want to be seen

downplaying the importance

of security from our
Communist allies.

Point taken. But, no.


You don't
get to say "no" to me.

It's my job to say "no"
to you when you're wrong.

So you have the job now?

Uh, I'm considering it.

I'm starting to see where
you got your reputation.

My favorite response,

"Oppenheimer couldn't
run a hamburger stand."

I couldn't.

But I can run the
Manhattan Project.

There's a way to
balance these things.

Keep the Rad Lab here at
Berkeley under Lawrence.

Met Lab in Chicago,
under Szilard.

Large-scale refining, where
did you say? Tennessee.

- And Hanford.
- And Hanford.

All America's industrial might
and scientific innovation,

connected by rail.

Focused on one goal.


One point in space and time.
And it comes together here.

A secret laboratory. In
the middle of nowhere,

secure, self-sufficient,

equipment, housing, the works.

Keep everyone there
until it's done.

It'll need a school,
stores, a church.

Why?

If we don't
let scientists

bring their families,
we'll never get the best.

You want security, build
a town, build it fast.

Where?

Welcome to Los Alamos.

Now, there's a boys school
we'll have to commandeer,

and the local Indians come
up here for burial rites.

But, apart from that, nothing.
Forty miles. Any direction.

Enough to find the perfect spot.


- For?
- Success.

Build him a town. Fast.

Let's go recruit
some scientists.

Why would I leave my family?

I told you, you can
bring your family.

I'm not a soldier, Oppie.

A soldier? He's a general.

I've got all the soldier I need.

What can I tell them?

Heisenberg, Diebner,
Bothe and Bohr.

What do these men
have in common?

The greatest minds
on atomic theory.

- Yes, and?
- Uh...

As much as you like,

until you feel my
boot on your balls.

You know isotopes and
you know explosives

better than anyone in the world.

But you can't tell
us what you're doing?




- I don't know.
- The Nazis have them.

- Niels Bohr's in Copenhagen.
- Under Nazi occupation.

Did they stop printing
newspapers in Princeton?

Why would we go to
the middle of nowhere

for who knows how
long?

For a year or two. Or three.

Uh, General, could
you give us a moment?

It's about unleashing
the strong force...

before the Nazis do.

Oh, my God.

Niels won't work for the Nazis.

No, never.

But while they
have him, we don't.

That's why I need you.

Why would you think I'd do that?

"Why?" "Why?"

How about because this is the
most important fucking thing

to ever happen in the
history of the world.

How about that?

Fuck.

They are not gonna let
me onto this project.

And failing a security
check is not gonna be good

for a career, even
after the war.

So you're a fellow
traveler. So what?

This is a national emergency.

I've got some skeletons,
they put me in charge.

They need us.

Until they don't.

Is there any chance of
getting Bohr out of Denmark?

Nah, no dice. I checked
with the British.

Until we get Allied boots
back onto the continent,

there's just no way.

Is he that important?

How many people do you know
who proved Einstein wrong?

You know, it really would
be quicker to take a plane.

No, plane's too risky.

Country needs us.

The Harvard guys,

they say the building's too
small for the cyclotron.

Get them together
with the architects.

When's this place
supposed to open?

Two months.

Robert, you're the
great improviser,

but this...

you can't do in your head.

Four divisions.

Experimental, Theoretical,
Metallurgical, Ordnance.

Who's running Theoretical?

I am.

That's what
I was afraid of.

You're spread too thin.

So you take Theoretical.

I'm not coming here, Robert.

Why not?

You drop a bomb and it falls
on the just and the unjust.

I don't wish the culmination
of three centuries of physics

to be a weapon of
mass destruction.

Izzy.

I don't know if we can be
trusted with such a weapon.

But I know the Nazis can't.

We have no choice.

Then...

the second thing you'll
have to do is appoint

Hans Bethe to run the
Theoretical division.

Wait, what was the first?

Take off that
ridiculous uniform.

You're a scientist.

Groves is insisting we join.

Tell Groves to go
shit in his hat.

They need us for who
we are. So be yourself.

Only better.

This is the only key.

And Teller's already here.

Shall I just show him in?

No, let's wait for the others.
Let's get started.

Hello, Edward.

Yes.

Gentlemen, so, we will work here

until the T-section at
Los Alamos is finished.

- Edward, can I please...
- It is more important.

When I calculated
the chain reaction,

I found a rather
troubling possibility.

No.

But this can't be right.

Show me how you did
your calculations.

Yes.

It's exponential.

No. No, no, no. No.

This is fantasy.

Teller's calculations
can't be right.

Do them yourself while
I go to Princeton.

- What for?
- To talk to Einstein.

Well, there's not much common
ground between you two.

That's why I should
get his view.

- Albert.
- Hmm?

Ah. Dr. Oppenheimer.

Well, have you met Dr. Gödel?

We walk here most days.

Trees are the most
inspiring structures.

Albert, might I have a word?

Of course. 'Scuse me, Kurt.

You know, some days,
Kurt refuses to eat.

Even in Princeton.

He's convinced that the
Nazis can poison his food.

Mm.

Hmm? Huh.

Wha...

Whose... Whose work is this?

Teller's.

What do you take it to mean?

Neutrons smash into nucleus,

releasing neutrons to
smash into other nuclei.


Criticality, a
point of no return,

massive explosive force.

But this time, the chain
reaction doesn't stop.

It would ignite the atmosphere.

When we detonate
an atomic device,

we might start a
chain reaction that...

destroys the world.

So here we are, hmm?

Lost in your quantum
world of probabilities

and needing certainty.

Can you run the
calculations yourself?

About the only thing

you and I have in common is
a disdain for mathematics.

Who's working on
this in-in Berkeley?

Hans Bethe.

Well, he'll get to the truth.

And if the truth
is catastrophic?

Then you stop.


And you share your
findings with the Nazis.

So neither side
destroys the world.

Robert.

This is yours, not mine.

Teller's wrong.

He's wrong.

When you know Teller's
critical assumptions,

the real picture emerges.

Bottom line?

The chances of an
uncontrolled nuclear reaction

are near zero.

Near zero.

- Oppie, this is good news.
- Mm.

Can you run them again?

No, you'll get the same answer.

Till they actually detonate
one of these things,

the best assurance you're
going to get is this.

Near zero.

Theory
will take you only so far.

- Mm.
- Hello!

- Hello, you.
- Hi.

We missed him.

You want to adopt?

She's kidding.

We wanted to see
you before we left.

For parts unknown.

You know who
I ran into the other day?

Eltenton.

Oh.

The chemist from
Shell? The union guy?

Yeah. He...
The, uh, F.A.E.C.T. guy.

He was moaning about how
we're handling the war.

How so?

Lack of cooperation
with our allies.

Apparently our
government's not sharing

any research with the Russians.

Well, he said,


"Most scientists think
the policy is stupid."

- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

He mentioned that if anyone

had anything they
wanted to pass on,

uh, going around
official channels,

that he could help.

That would be treason.

Yes, of course.

I just thought you should know.

The brat is down.

Where are the martinis?

Coming right up.

Conversation ended there.

Nothing in our
long-standing friendship

would have led me to believe

that Chevalier was actually
seeking information,

and I am certain
that he had no idea

of the work in
which I was engaged.

It has long been clear to me

that I should have reported
this incident at once.

The
Oppenheimer situation

highlights the tension
between scientists

and the security apparatus.

In hopes of learning
how the nominee handled

such issues during
his time at the AEC,

we'll have a scientist
appearing before the committee.

Who are they bringing in?

They hadn't said.

Mr. Chairman,
if I may,

I'm nominated for
Commerce Secretary.

Why seek the opinion
of scientists?

This is a Cabinet post, Admiral.

We seek a wide range of opinion.

Well, I'd like to know the name
of the scientist testifying.

I'd like the chance
to cross-examine.

This is not a court.

Formality, huh?

No
presidential Cabinet nominee

has failed to be
confirmed since 1925.

This is just how
the game is played.

It's in the bag, Lewis.

So play nice.

They bring in a
scientist, so what?

You don't know scientists
like I do, Counselor.

They resent anyone who
questions their judgment,

especially if you're
not one of them.

I was chair of the AEC.

I'm easy to blame for
what happened to Robert.

We can't have the
Senate thinking

the scientific community
doesn't support you, sir.

Or should we pivot?

- To what?
- And embrace it.

"I fought Oppenheimer,
and the US won."


I-I don't think we
need to go there.

Isn't there someone we can call
who knows what really happened?

- Teller.
- He'll make an impression.

Can you get the name of the
scientist they've called?

- Probably.
- Find out if he was

based in Chicago or Los
Alamos during the war.

Why does that matter?

Well, if he was
based in Chicago,

then he worked under
Szilard and Fermi,

not the cult of
Oppie at Los Alamos.

Robert built that damn place.

He was founder, mayor, sheriff,

all rolled into one.

All it needs is a saloon.

There's no kitchen.

Really? We'll fix that.

Barbed wire, guns.

Oppie.


We're at war, Hans.

Halifax. 1917.

A cargo ship carrying munitions
explodes in the harbor.

A vast and sudden
chemical reaction.

The biggest man-made
explosion in history.

Now let's calculate how
much more destructive

it would have been
if it were a nuclear

and not a chemical reaction.

Expressing power in
terms of tons of TNT.

But it will be thousands.

Well, then kilotons.

Using U-235,

- the bomb will need a...
- Uh-uh.

Sorry. Gadget will
need a 33-pound sphere

about this size.

Or using plutonium,
the ten-pound sphere.

Here's the amount of uranium

Oak Ridge refined
all of last month.

And the Hanford plant
made this much plutonium.

Now, if we can
enrich these amounts,

we need a way to detonate them.

Are we boring you, Edward?

A little bit, yes.

May I ask why?

We all
entered this room

knowing a fission
bomb was possible.

How 'bout we leave it
with something new?

Such as?

Instead of uranium or plutonium,

we use hydrogen.

- Heavy hydrogen.
- Hydrogen.

Deuterium. You see?

We compact the atoms together

under great pressure to
induce a fusion reaction.

Then we'll get not kilotons,

but megatons.

A big
fission reaction...

Okay, hang on, hang on.

So how do you generate enough
force to fuse hydrogen atoms?

A small fission bomb.

There we are.

Well, since we're going
to need one anyway,

can we get back to
the business at hand?

The isotopes issue

wasn't your most important
policy disagreement

with Dr. Oppenheimer.

It was the hydrogen
bomb, wasn't it?

Uh, as colleagues,
we agreed to disagree

on a great many things, uh,

and, well, one of them

was the need for an
H-bomb program, yes.

Thanks for convening
on short notice.

I can't believe it.

Well, here we are.

Catch me up. What do we know?

One of our B-29s over
the North Pacific

has detected radiation.

Do we have the filter papers?

There's no doubt what this is.

White House says
there's a doubt.

Wishful thinking, I'm afraid.

Are those the long-range
detection filter papers?

It's an atomic test.

The Russians have a bomb.

We're supposed to be years
ahead of them, but some...

What were you guys
doing at Los Alamos?

Wasn't security tight?

Of course it was.
You weren't there.

- It was...
- Forgive me, Doctor...

but I was there.

We can now consider

the actual mechanics
of detonation.

Any ideas?

I call
this "shooting."

We fire a chunk of fissionable
material into a larger sphere

with enough force to
achieve criticality.

What do we think? Anyone?

I've been
thinking about implosion.

Explosives around the
sphere blast inwards,

crushing the material.

I'd like to
investigate that idea.

I'll talk to Ordnance,
get you blowing things up.

Progress?

Nice to see you too.

Meet the British contingent.

Dr. Oppenheimer, Klaus Fuchs.

How long have you been British?

Since Hitler told
me I wasn't German.

Uh-huh. Come, welcome
to Los Alamos.

School's up and running.

Bar. Always running.

And I thought of a way
to reduce support staff.

- Is that...
- Mrs. Serber, yes.

I've offered jobs
to all the wives.

Admin, librarians, computation.

We cut down on staff,
keep families together.

- Are these women qualified?
- Don't be absurd.

These are some of the brightest
minds in our community.

And they're already
security cleared.

I've informed General
Groves you've been holding

cross-divisional
open discussions

- on a nightly basis.
- Shut them down.

Compartmentalization is the
key to maintaining security...

It's only the top men.

Who presumably communicate
with subordinates.

These men aren't stupid.

- They can be discreet.
- I don't like it.

You don't like anything enough
for that to be a fair test.

Once a week. Top men only.


I'd like to bring
my brother here.

No.

Uh, Nichols...

I still haven't heard
that my security clearance

- has been approved.
- It hasn't.

We're going to Chicago tomorrow.

No, you should wait.

You are aware that the Nazis
have a two-year head start.

Dr. Oppenheimer, the fact
that your security clearance

is proving difficult to
obtain is not my fault.

It's yours.

May not be your fault,
but it's your problem.

Because I'm going.

And how many
people were in these, uh,

- open discussions?
- Too many.

Compartmentalization was
supposed to be the protocol.

We were in a race
against the Nazis.


And now the race is
against the Soviets.

- Not unless we start it.
- Robert.

They just fired a starting gun.

What's the nature of the
device they detonated?

The data
indicates it may have been

a plutonium implosion device.


Like the one you
built at Los Alamos.

The Russians have a bomb,

Truman needs to
know what's next.

What's next? Arms talks.

- Arms talks.
- Obviously.

What about the Super?

Does Truman even know about it?

Did we brief him on that?

Not specifically.

We still don't know

if a hydrogen bomb's
technically feasible.

Right, my understanding is
that Teller proposed it?

- Yes.
- At Los Alamos?

Teller's designs have always
been wildly impractical.

You'd have to
deliver by ox cart.

- Not airplane.
- Oppie.

I'm sorry, Dr. Lawrence,
you want to comment?

No.

Because if it can
put us ahead again,

the President of
the United States

needs to know about it.

And if the Russians
know about it already,

from a spy at Los Alamos,

then we've gotta get going.

There's no proof there
was a spy at Los Alamos.

Robert.

They put it under
the football stadium?

The field's not in use anymore.

Just as well.

- Oppie.
- Dr. Fermi.

I hear you got a little town.

Yes. Come and see.

Who could think straight
in a place like that? Huh?

Everybody will go crazy.

Thank you for the vote
of confidence, Szilard.

Do we really... do we really
need that in the notes?

When are you going
to try it out?

We did.

The first self-sustaining
nuclear chain reaction.

Didn't Groves tell you?

No.

One at a time,
please, one at a time.

Dr. Oppenheimer?

I tried Personnel. They
asked if I could type.

Can you?

Harvard forgot to teach that

on the graduate
chemistry course.

Condon, put Mrs. Hornig
here on the plutonium team.

What the hell were
you doing in Chicago?

Visiting the Met?

- Why? Why?
- Well, you can't talk to...

Because we have every right...

You have just the
rights that I give you.

No more, no less.

We are adults trying
to run a project here.

This is ridiculous.

Tell him.

Compartmentalization is
the protocol we agreed to.

Enough of this madhouse.

Nobody can work under
these conditions.

You know what,
Generalissimo? I quit.

Thanks for nothing.

Better
off without him.

Aren't you more concerned

about his discretion out there?

We'll have him killed.

I was just kidding.

- No, he hates me, not America.
- You know, General,

1404
01:09:24,833 --> 01:09:27,169
not everyone has levers
to pull like mine.

1405
01:09:27,202 --> 01:09:29,037
I don't think I understand.

1406
01:09:29,071 --> 01:09:31,239
You didn't hire me
despite my left-wing past.

1407
01:09:31,273 --> 01:09:33,008
You hired me because of it.

1408
01:09:34,009 --> 01:09:35,978
So you could control me.

1409
01:09:36,011 --> 01:09:38,612
Well, I'm not that subtle.

1410
01:09:38,646 --> 01:09:40,681
I'm just a humble soldier.

1411
01:09:40,715 --> 01:09:42,226
You're neither humble
nor just a soldier.

1412
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:43,261
You studied engineering at MIT.

1413
01:09:43,285 --> 01:09:45,120
Guilty as charged.

1414
01:09:45,153 --> 01:09:46,654
Well, now we
understand each other,

1415
01:09:46,687 --> 01:09:48,132
perhaps you can get me
my security clearance

1416
01:09:48,156 --> 01:09:50,959
so I can perform
this miracle for you.

1417
01:09:55,864 --> 01:09:57,607
General
Groves, were you aware

1418
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:59,935
of Dr. Oppenheimer's
left-wing associations

1419
01:09:59,968 --> 01:10:01,635
when you appointed him?

1420
01:10:01,669 --> 01:10:03,314
I was aware that there
were suspicions about him.

1421
01:10:03,338 --> 01:10:05,207
I was aware he
had a very extreme

1422
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:06,607
liberal background.

1423
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:08,252
In your opinion, would
he ever consciously

1424
01:10:08,276 --> 01:10:09,577
commit a disloyal act?

1425
01:10:09,610 --> 01:10:11,213
I would be amazed if he did.

1426
01:10:11,246 --> 01:10:14,316
So you had complete
confidence in his integrity.

1427
01:10:14,349 --> 01:10:15,750
At Los Alamos, yes,

1428
01:10:15,783 --> 01:10:17,119
which is where I
really knew him.

1429
01:10:17,152 --> 01:10:19,121
General, did your
security officers

1430
01:10:19,154 --> 01:10:20,621
on the project advise you

1431
01:10:20,654 --> 01:10:22,133
against the clearance
of Dr. Oppenheimer?

1432
01:10:22,157 --> 01:10:25,961
They could not and would not
clear him until I insisted.

1433
01:10:25,994 --> 01:10:28,629
And it's safe to say that you
had a pretty good knowledge

1434
01:10:28,662 --> 01:10:29,907
of Dr. Oppenheimer's
security file.

1435
01:10:29,931 --> 01:10:31,599
I did.

1436
01:10:31,632 --> 01:10:32,810
Well, then there's only
really one question

1437
01:10:32,834 --> 01:10:34,302
I need answered here today.

1438
01:10:34,336 --> 01:10:36,038
In light of the
current AEC guidelines,

1439
01:10:36,071 --> 01:10:38,773
would you clear
Dr. Oppenheimer today?

1440
01:10:38,807 --> 01:10:40,876
Do you have the guidelines?

1441
01:10:47,949 --> 01:10:50,618
Under current
AEC guidelines,

1442
01:10:50,651 --> 01:10:52,686
would you clear
Dr. Oppenheimer today?

1443
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:08,702
Physics and New
Mexico, huh?

1444
01:11:08,736 --> 01:11:11,772
My God. What a trek.

1445
01:11:11,807 --> 01:11:13,275
That's why you need a liaison.

1446
01:11:13,308 --> 01:11:14,843
I'm appointing Lomanitz.

1447
01:11:16,011 --> 01:11:17,079
You're gonna be okay.

1448
01:11:17,112 --> 01:11:18,280
This way, gentlemen.

1449
01:11:28,256 --> 01:11:30,092
- Dr. Lawrence.
- Leslie.

1450
01:11:30,125 --> 01:11:32,693
I'd like to remind you what
we talked about in Berkeley.

1451
01:11:32,726 --> 01:11:35,063
Compartmentalization. I
understand completely.

1452
01:11:38,233 --> 01:11:39,234
Okay.

1453
01:11:40,402 --> 01:11:41,837
Thank you.

1454
01:11:49,743 --> 01:11:50,988
Greetings
from Berkeley.

1455
01:11:51,012 --> 01:11:53,148
I am here to update
you on our progress

1456
01:11:53,181 --> 01:11:54,715
and solicit your input.

1457
01:11:54,748 --> 01:11:56,127
To do so, I am going
to have to share

1458
01:11:56,151 --> 01:11:59,821
a few things that General
Groves told me not to.

1459
01:11:59,855 --> 01:12:01,655
Sorry, General, I
said I understood,

1460
01:12:01,689 --> 01:12:02,756
not that I agreed.

1461
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:04,326
'Kay.

1462
01:12:04,359 --> 01:12:06,394
Gentlemen, to business.

1463
01:12:06,428 --> 01:12:08,796
There were rumors of
espionage at Los Alamos.

1464
01:12:08,830 --> 01:12:10,308
Unsubstantiated.
Unsubstantiated.

1465
01:12:10,332 --> 01:12:11,799
I'm told

1466
01:12:11,833 --> 01:12:13,144
that there were
Communists on the project.

1467
01:12:13,168 --> 01:12:14,936
We didn't knowingly
employ any Communists.

1468
01:12:14,970 --> 01:12:16,746
I just want to know,
were any of them involved

1469
01:12:16,770 --> 01:12:18,240
in discussions of the Super?

1470
01:12:18,273 --> 01:12:20,451
I seem to remember you demanding
your brother come to Los Alamos.

1471
01:12:20,475 --> 01:12:22,743
My brother had left
the Party by then.

1472
01:12:22,776 --> 01:12:24,012
What about Lomanitz?

1473
01:12:24,045 --> 01:12:25,779
Lomanitz was never
employed at Los Alamos.

1474
01:12:25,814 --> 01:12:26,815
He was a liaison.

1475
01:12:26,848 --> 01:12:28,016
Our security was tight,

1476
01:12:28,049 --> 01:12:29,427
as former Colonel
Nichols well knows.

1477
01:12:29,451 --> 01:12:31,019
Our security was as
tight as it could be

1478
01:12:31,052 --> 01:12:32,420
given the
personalities involved,

1479
01:12:32,454 --> 01:12:34,289
but attempts were made.

1480
01:12:34,322 --> 01:12:35,333
What is that supposed to mean?

1481
01:12:35,357 --> 01:12:36,925
We've all read his file here.

1482
01:12:37,959 --> 01:12:39,961
Do we need to talk
about Jean Tatlock?

1483
01:12:40,495 --> 01:12:42,663
Or the Chevalier incident?

1484
01:12:47,269 --> 01:12:48,669
'Scuse me.

1485
01:12:51,973 --> 01:12:53,942
That's
Lomanitz, line one.

1486
01:12:59,814 --> 01:13:00,849
Hello, Rossi.

1487
01:13:00,882 --> 01:13:04,085
What? O-Okay, just calm down.

1488
01:13:05,053 --> 01:13:08,290
There's been another screw-up.
Lomanitz just got drafted.

1489
01:13:08,323 --> 01:13:10,791
- We are at war, Doctor.
- Don't be an asshole, Nichols.

1490
01:13:10,825 --> 01:13:12,827
We need this kid.
Fix it, will you?

1491
01:13:12,861 --> 01:13:14,062
It wasn't a mistake.

1492
01:13:14,095 --> 01:13:15,439
Your friend Lomanitz
has been trying

1493
01:13:15,463 --> 01:13:17,731
to unionize the Radiation Lab.

1494
01:13:17,765 --> 01:13:19,067
He promised to quit all that.

1495
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:21,002
Well, he hasn't.

1496
01:13:21,036 --> 01:13:22,904
Security officer at
Berkeley's concerned about

1497
01:13:22,938 --> 01:13:25,240
Communist infiltration
through that union,

1498
01:13:25,273 --> 01:13:27,876
- the F.A...
- F.A.E.C.T.

1499
01:13:30,278 --> 01:13:33,982
While I'm there next week,
I'll drop in to see him.

1500
01:13:36,251 --> 01:13:37,986
Your Q clearance came through.

1501
01:13:41,523 --> 01:13:42,967
It's important you
not maintain or renew

1502
01:13:42,991 --> 01:13:45,260
any questionable associations.

1503
01:13:49,998 --> 01:13:52,500
Doctor, did you
think social contacts

1504
01:13:52,534 --> 01:13:54,869
between a person engaged
on secret war work

1505
01:13:54,903 --> 01:13:56,271
and Communists was dangerous?

1506
01:13:56,304 --> 01:13:59,975
My awareness of the danger
would be greater today.

1507
01:14:00,008 --> 01:14:02,911
I mean, it's fair to say
that during the war years,

1508
01:14:02,944 --> 01:14:06,147
you felt that such contacts
were potentially dangerous.

1509
01:14:12,587 --> 01:14:15,557
Were conceivably
dangerous, yes.

1510
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:17,859
I mean, really,

1511
01:14:17,892 --> 01:14:19,928
known Communists.

1512
01:14:22,063 --> 01:14:24,299
Look...

1513
01:14:24,332 --> 01:14:25,867
I've had a lot of secrets

1514
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:28,870
in my head for a long time.

1515
01:14:29,838 --> 01:14:31,115
Doesn't matter who
I associate with.

1516
01:14:31,139 --> 01:14:34,042
I don't talk about
those secrets.

1517
01:14:41,449 --> 01:14:43,084
You said
in your statement

1518
01:14:43,118 --> 01:14:49,057
that you had to see
Jean Tatlock in 1943.

1519
01:14:50,525 --> 01:14:52,193
You left.

1520
01:14:53,428 --> 01:14:54,863
Not a word.

1521
01:14:54,896 --> 01:14:57,365
What did you think
that would do to me?

1522
01:14:58,466 --> 01:14:59,534
I wrote.

1523
01:14:59,567 --> 01:15:01,970
Pages of nothing.

1524
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:06,574
Where did you go?

1525
01:15:06,608 --> 01:15:09,044
- I can't tell you.
- Why not?

1526
01:15:09,077 --> 01:15:11,813
Because you're a Communist.

1527
01:15:13,348 --> 01:15:15,216
Why did you have to see her?

1528
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:18,353
Because she had
indicated a great desire

1529
01:15:18,386 --> 01:15:20,055
to see me before we left.

1530
01:15:20,088 --> 01:15:21,256
At that time, I couldn't,

1531
01:15:21,289 --> 01:15:25,093
but I felt that
she had to see me.

1532
01:15:25,126 --> 01:15:27,629
She was undergoing
psychiatric treatment.

1533
01:15:27,662 --> 01:15:29,898
She was extremely unhappy.

1534
01:15:29,931 --> 01:15:31,933
Did you find out why
she had to see you?

1535
01:15:37,038 --> 01:15:39,107
Because she was still
in love with me.

1536
01:15:46,314 --> 01:15:48,383
Spent the night
together, didn't you?

1537
01:15:56,358 --> 01:15:57,392
Yes.

1538
01:16:03,064 --> 01:16:06,935
You drop in and out of my life,

1539
01:16:06,968 --> 01:16:09,437
and you don't have
to tell me why.

1540
01:16:09,471 --> 01:16:10,939
Now that's power.

1541
01:16:10,972 --> 01:16:13,007
Not that I enjoy.

1542
01:16:13,975 --> 01:16:16,111
I'd rather be here
for you as you need.

1543
01:16:16,144 --> 01:16:18,613
But you have other
priorities now.

1544
01:16:18,646 --> 01:16:21,416
I have a wife and child.

1545
01:16:22,417 --> 01:16:25,220
That's not what either
of us is talking about.

1546
01:16:28,656 --> 01:16:30,525
Jean.

1547
01:16:30,558 --> 01:16:32,694
You asked me to come.

1548
01:16:32,727 --> 01:16:35,096
And I'm glad I did.

1549
01:16:35,730 --> 01:16:38,299
But I can't see you again.

1550
01:16:40,702 --> 01:16:42,404
But what if I need you?

1551
01:16:45,974 --> 01:16:48,943
You said you would
always answer.

1552
01:16:51,413 --> 01:16:52,547
Not a word?

1553
01:16:53,816 --> 01:16:54,892
Did you think that
consistent with good security?

1554
01:16:54,916 --> 01:16:57,585
As a matter of fact, it was.

1555
01:16:57,619 --> 01:16:59,988
Not a word.

1556
01:17:00,021 --> 01:17:02,190
When did you
see her after that?

1557
01:17:10,598 --> 01:17:12,267
I never saw her again.

1558
01:17:18,473 --> 01:17:21,109
I can make the last
train back to Princeton.

1559
01:17:21,142 --> 01:17:24,312
Kitty, I didn't say anything
that I hadn't already told you.

1560
01:17:24,345 --> 01:17:26,481
Today you said it to
history, didn't you?

1561
01:17:26,514 --> 01:17:28,049
This is a closed hearing.

1562
01:17:29,751 --> 01:17:31,362
If they don't
release the transcript,

1563
01:17:31,386 --> 01:17:33,388
- I'm sure you will.
- I was under oath.

1564
01:17:33,421 --> 01:17:35,190
Well, you were
under an oath for me

1565
01:17:35,223 --> 01:17:37,025
when you went to see Jean.

1566
01:17:37,692 --> 01:17:39,127
You know, you...

1567
01:17:40,028 --> 01:17:42,330
you sit there, day after day,

1568
01:17:42,363 --> 01:17:45,400
letting them pick
our lives to pieces.

1569
01:17:48,403 --> 01:17:50,104
Why won't you fight?

1570
01:17:53,241 --> 01:17:56,377
Robert, I'm
not putting her up there.

1571
01:18:01,516 --> 01:18:04,385
Dr. Oppenheimer, it's an
honor. Please, take a seat.

1572
01:18:04,419 --> 01:18:08,022
No need, um, I just wanted
to check whether I should

1573
01:18:08,056 --> 01:18:10,225
talk to Lomanitz while I'm
here, given your concerns.

1574
01:18:10,258 --> 01:18:12,360
Well, I'd say that's really
up to you, Professor,

1575
01:18:12,393 --> 01:18:14,562
- but I'd be cautious.
- Uh-huh. Understood.

1576
01:18:14,596 --> 01:18:17,332
Oh, and, um,
as regards to the union,

1577
01:18:17,365 --> 01:18:19,133
I wanted to give you
a heads-up on a...

1578
01:18:19,167 --> 01:18:20,502
on a man named Eltenton.

1579
01:18:20,535 --> 01:18:22,036
A heads-up?

1580
01:18:22,070 --> 01:18:26,007
Yes, just that he might
merit watching is all.

1581
01:18:26,809 --> 01:18:28,243
Well, I'd love to
get more details.

1582
01:18:28,276 --> 01:18:30,612
Well, I... I have
an appointment now

1583
01:18:30,645 --> 01:18:32,080
and I leave early tomorrow.

1584
01:18:32,113 --> 01:18:33,648
Well, come back as
early as you like.

1585
01:18:33,681 --> 01:18:36,017
Since you haven't time now.

1586
01:18:36,684 --> 01:18:38,520
You went back the next morning.

1587
01:18:38,553 --> 01:18:40,555
I did, I had to, really.

1588
01:18:41,489 --> 01:18:44,092
This time, there
was another man.

1589
01:18:44,759 --> 01:18:46,261
He said his name's Pash.

1590
01:18:46,294 --> 01:18:48,796
Pash. You met Colonel Pash?

1591
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:50,374
Colonel Pash,
could you please read

1592
01:18:50,398 --> 01:18:54,202
from your memo
dated June 29, 1943?

1593
01:18:56,304 --> 01:18:58,406
"Results of surveillance
conducted on subject

1594
01:18:58,439 --> 01:19:01,276
"indicate further possible
Communist Party connections.

1595
01:19:01,309 --> 01:19:03,478
"Subject met with and
spent considerable time

1596
01:19:03,511 --> 01:19:05,713
"with one Jean
Tatlock, Communist,

1597
01:19:05,747 --> 01:19:07,215
the record of whom is attached."

1598
01:19:07,248 --> 01:19:09,117
The subject being
Dr. Oppenheimer?

1599
01:19:09,150 --> 01:19:11,619
- Yes.
- Whom you had not met?

1600
01:19:11,653 --> 01:19:13,454
Not then,
but soon after.

1601
01:19:13,488 --> 01:19:14,866
He's the head of
security for the project.

1602
01:19:14,890 --> 01:19:16,124
Shouldn't I know him?

1603
01:19:16,157 --> 01:19:17,492
No, he should know you.

1604
01:19:17,525 --> 01:19:19,427
I would never put you
in a room with Pash.

1605
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:20,728
Why not?

1606
01:19:20,762 --> 01:19:22,831
When Pash first
heard about Lomanitz,

1607
01:19:22,865 --> 01:19:25,800
he told the FBI he
was gonna kidnap him,

1608
01:19:25,834 --> 01:19:27,302
take him out on a boat

1609
01:19:27,335 --> 01:19:30,338
and interrogate him
in the Russian manner.

1610
01:19:32,473 --> 01:19:35,310
General Groves has placed in
me a certain responsibility,

1611
01:19:35,343 --> 01:19:37,579
and it's like having a
child who I can't see.

1612
01:19:37,612 --> 01:19:39,714
- Ah.
- By remote control.

1613
01:19:39,747 --> 01:19:43,351
So to actually meet you is...

1614
01:19:44,452 --> 01:19:45,897
I won't take up too
much of your time.

1615
01:19:45,921 --> 01:19:48,189
No, no, not at all.
Whatever time you choose.

1616
01:19:48,222 --> 01:19:51,125
Mm. Mr. Johnson told
me of a conversation

1617
01:19:51,159 --> 01:19:52,904
you had yesterday in
which I'm very interested.

1618
01:19:52,928 --> 01:19:55,196
It's had me worried all day.

1619
01:19:55,229 --> 01:19:57,732
Yes, well, I didn't
want to talk to Lomanitz

1620
01:19:57,765 --> 01:19:59,300
without authorization.

1621
01:19:59,334 --> 01:20:00,544
That's not the particular
interest that I have.

1622
01:20:00,568 --> 01:20:02,537
It's something a
little bit more...

1623
01:20:03,571 --> 01:20:05,340
well, in my opinion,
more serious.

1624
01:20:05,373 --> 01:20:08,309
Now, when the FBI pointed
out that such information

1625
01:20:08,343 --> 01:20:09,888
wouldn't be admissible in
court, Pash made it clear

1626
01:20:09,912 --> 01:20:13,681
he had no intention of leaving
any witness left to prosecute.

1627
01:20:13,715 --> 01:20:15,283
Now, the FBI talked him down,

1628
01:20:15,316 --> 01:20:16,885
but that's the man
you're dancing with.

1629
01:20:16,919 --> 01:20:19,621
I gather you've heard
there are other parties

1630
01:20:19,654 --> 01:20:22,357
interested in the work
of the Radiation Lab.

1631
01:20:22,390 --> 01:20:26,294
A man attached to
the Soviet Consul

1632
01:20:26,327 --> 01:20:29,364
indicated, through
intermediate people,

1633
01:20:29,397 --> 01:20:30,933
to people on this project,

1634
01:20:30,966 --> 01:20:34,402
that he was in a position
to transmit information.

1635
01:20:34,435 --> 01:20:37,271
Oh, why would anyone on the
project want to do that?

1636
01:20:38,706 --> 01:20:41,242
Frankly, I can see that
there might be an argument

1637
01:20:41,275 --> 01:20:43,678
for the Commander-in-Chief
informing the Russians...

1638
01:20:43,711 --> 01:20:45,580
they're our allies after all...

1639
01:20:45,613 --> 01:20:48,516
but I don't like the idea of
it going out the back door.

1640
01:20:48,549 --> 01:20:51,285
It might not hurt to be
on the lookout for it.

1641
01:20:52,687 --> 01:20:53,856
And you said that to Pash?

1642
01:20:53,889 --> 01:20:55,390
I was trying to put it

1643
01:20:55,423 --> 01:20:58,259
in a context of
Russia's not Germany.

1644
01:20:58,292 --> 01:21:02,697
Boris Pash is the son of
a Russian Orthodox bishop.

1645
01:21:02,730 --> 01:21:06,234
Born here, but in 1918,
he went back to Russia

1646
01:21:06,267 --> 01:21:07,702
to fight the Bolsheviks.

1647
01:21:07,735 --> 01:21:09,914
This is a man who has killed
Communists with his own hands.

1648
01:21:09,938 --> 01:21:13,408
I'm not the judge of who should
or should not have information.

1649
01:21:13,441 --> 01:21:15,486
It's my business to stop it
from going through illegally.

1650
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:17,712
Would you be a
little more specific?

1651
01:21:20,581 --> 01:21:23,451
There's a man whose
name was mentioned to me

1652
01:21:23,484 --> 01:21:25,586
a couple of times. Eltenton.

1653
01:21:26,621 --> 01:21:29,724
Uh, I believe he's a
chemist who works at Shell.

1654
01:21:29,757 --> 01:21:32,293
He talked to a friend of his

1655
01:21:32,326 --> 01:21:36,230
who's an acquaintance of
someone on the project.

1656
01:21:37,465 --> 01:21:39,902
And you thought Pash would
be satisfied with that?

1657
01:21:39,935 --> 01:21:42,470
I was attempting to
give them Eltenton

1658
01:21:42,503 --> 01:21:43,839
without opening a can of worms.

1659
01:21:43,872 --> 01:21:45,841
I told them a
cock-and-bull story.

1660
01:21:45,874 --> 01:21:47,408
Did you lie to
General Groves too?

1661
01:21:47,442 --> 01:21:50,979
No. I admitted to him
that I'd lied to Pash.

1662
01:21:51,013 --> 01:21:52,456
Do you recall
this conversation

1663
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:54,883
about the Chevalier incident?

1664
01:21:54,917 --> 01:21:57,318
I've seen so many
versions of it. Um...

1665
01:21:57,351 --> 01:21:58,519
Wasn't confused before,

1666
01:21:58,553 --> 01:21:59,988
but I'm certainly
getting there now.

1667
01:22:00,022 --> 01:22:01,331
And what
was your conclusion?

1668
01:22:01,355 --> 01:22:03,725
That he was under
the influence of

1669
01:22:03,758 --> 01:22:06,627
the typical American
schoolboy attitude

1670
01:22:06,661 --> 01:22:10,264
that there's something wicked
about telling on a friend.

1671
01:22:10,298 --> 01:22:12,333
Well, now.

1672
01:22:12,366 --> 01:22:14,802
Might we know through
whom the contact was made?

1673
01:22:14,837 --> 01:22:17,039
That would in... involve people

1674
01:22:17,072 --> 01:22:19,041
who are not to be
involved in this.

1675
01:22:19,074 --> 01:22:21,844
Is that someone a
member of the project?

1676
01:22:21,877 --> 01:22:26,414
A member of the faculty, yes,
but not in the project, no.

1677
01:22:26,447 --> 01:22:27,548
Ah.

1678
01:22:27,582 --> 01:22:29,350
So Eltenton made his approach

1679
01:22:29,383 --> 01:22:32,620
through a member of the
faculty here at Berkeley?

1680
01:22:34,355 --> 01:22:36,825
As far as I know. As
far as I know, yes.

1681
01:22:36,859 --> 01:22:39,494
But there-there may have been

1682
01:22:39,527 --> 01:22:42,263
more than one person involved.

1683
01:22:45,666 --> 01:22:48,871
Gentlemen, if I... if
I seem uncooperative,

1684
01:22:48,904 --> 01:22:51,840
I think you can understand
that's because of my insistence

1685
01:22:51,874 --> 01:22:54,475
in not getting innocent
people into trouble.

1686
01:22:54,509 --> 01:22:56,310
You're trying
to protect your friend.

1687
01:22:56,344 --> 01:22:57,578
Who's protecting you?

1688
01:22:57,612 --> 01:22:59,014
Well, you could.

1689
01:22:59,047 --> 01:23:00,381
If you gave me the name.

1690
01:23:00,414 --> 01:23:02,350
If you order me to, I'll do it.

1691
01:23:02,383 --> 01:23:03,417
That's a mistake, Robert.

1692
01:23:03,451 --> 01:23:05,286
You need to volunteer this name.

1693
01:23:06,121 --> 01:23:07,789
And did he
give you the name?

1694
01:23:07,823 --> 01:23:08,957
He did.

1695
01:23:08,991 --> 01:23:10,458
- But not then, did he?
- No.

1696
01:23:10,491 --> 01:23:11,970
No. In fact, it was some
months later, wasn't it?

1697
01:23:11,994 --> 01:23:13,896
It was.

1698
01:23:13,929 --> 01:23:15,030
You see me as persistent.

1699
01:23:15,063 --> 01:23:16,798
Well, you are...

1700
01:23:16,832 --> 01:23:18,666
you are persistent,
but that is your job.

1701
01:23:18,699 --> 01:23:22,403
And-and my job is to protect
the people that work for me.

1702
01:23:22,436 --> 01:23:24,438
Instead of us
going on certain steps,

1703
01:23:24,472 --> 01:23:26,574
which may come to
your attention...

1704
01:23:27,943 --> 01:23:29,710
and be disturbing to you,

1705
01:23:29,744 --> 01:23:32,848
I would like to discuss
those with you first.

1706
01:23:32,881 --> 01:23:34,382
I'm not formulating a plan.

1707
01:23:34,415 --> 01:23:36,751
I'll just have to
digest the whole thing.

1708
01:23:40,388 --> 01:23:43,091
In the months in
between your interview

1709
01:23:43,125 --> 01:23:46,761
with Dr. Oppenheimer and his
eventual naming of Chevalier,

1710
01:23:46,794 --> 01:23:48,096
did you expend resources

1711
01:23:48,130 --> 01:23:49,606
trying to find the name
of the intermediary?

1712
01:23:49,630 --> 01:23:52,100
Considerable resources, yes.

1713
01:23:52,134 --> 01:23:54,368
Without the name, our job
was extremely difficult.

1714
01:23:54,402 --> 01:23:55,838
And when did you
receive the name?

1715
01:23:55,871 --> 01:23:57,105
I was gone by the time

1716
01:23:57,139 --> 01:23:59,574
-Oppenheimer finally offered it up.
-Gone?

1717
01:23:59,607 --> 01:24:01,776
They felt my time would
be better spent in Europe

1718
01:24:01,810 --> 01:24:04,545
determining the status
of the Nazi bomb project.

1719
01:24:04,579 --> 01:24:05,746
Who did?

1720
01:24:06,849 --> 01:24:08,583
General Groves.
